# Simple-login-page


I have created a simple login page using HTML and CSS. The page asks users to enter their Username and Password.
If the user does not have an account, they can click on the " Register" link to register.
In case the user forgets their password, there is a "Forgot Password?" link that they can click to reset it.
This login form provides a clean and user-friendly interface for authentication.
